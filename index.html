            <p>My name is Azeez Davis I'm 23 years old and I grew up in philadelphia,I currently Work for a logistics company full
              time, but when I'm not working I like to occupy myself by doing activities that I love. Among those things
              are coding and playing sports. I developed a love for computer science at a young age, I'd find myself
              building and creating small games and other things im not proud of like pirating movies.. but I knew I
              wanted to have a career in computer science, it is my absolute dream. As for sports.. well I was pretty
              good, but I stopped growing and took that as a sign that god had other plans for me.
