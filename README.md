# homework-2
For this Assignement I focused on first creating the nav-bar, making it responsive and consistant on each page, then I focused on my index.html page, creating a small box model within it a image and paragraph describing myself.. then for the contact page I copied a boostrap link and Styled it slightly with css of my own..for the portfolio page I kept the placeholder images and used a container , row and unordered list to insert the images,
then I tried the best of my abilties to make everything semantic.
